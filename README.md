# Login-UI-Jetpack-Compose
This Git repository showcases my first experience with Jetpack Compose, a powerful UI toolkit for Android development. I explore the incredible features, freedom, and customization offered by Jetpack Compose, which surpass traditional XML layouts.

In this repository, you'll find a recreated login UI for the Taktak mobile app!

Taktak is an application to which I have contributed, aimed at enhancing the interaction and convenience between service providers and their valued customers
